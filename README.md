We propose a novel method aimed at community detection in social esports networks by combining the Girvan-Newman algorithm with the modularity concept from the Louvain algorithm. Our approach enables the detection to more optimized and more time efficient. In this project, we explore the fascinating world of online gaming communities through the lens of Valorant, a multiplayer first-person shooting game developed by Riot Games. We apply our community detection approach to the Valorant communities on Twitter, which consist of players, streamers, and organizations.

Our findings reveal distinct communities for different Valorant agents and different regions. We also observe influential players and organizations that act as center nodes, and smaller communities that form around them. The Louvain algorithm produces the most cohesive communities with the highest modularity scores, while the Girvan-Newman algorithm identifies smaller, more specific sub-communities within the larger communities detected by the Louvain algorithm. Our study contributes to the existing literature on community detection and social networks by providing insights into the Valorant communities on Twitter. It also sheds light on the growing popularity of esports and its potential as a career path for young people.

We detect communities in a game called “Valorant” based on Twitter data and detect many important insights using centrality measures and network analysis – python, and Selenium(Web scrapping)
• Implement an improved Girvan-Newman Algorithm
• Tools:python,pyvis, NetworkX, Jupyter Notebook,etc.
